// IE10 on Windows Phone 8
// IE10 on WP8 doesn't report CSS pixels, but actual device pixels. In
// other words, say on a Lumia, you'll get 768px as the device width,
// meaning users will see the tablet styles and not phone styles.
//
// Alternatively you can override this with JS (see source below), but
// we won't be doing that here given our limited scope.
