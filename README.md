# Bootstrap Ruby Gem

This is the future home of the Bootstrap v4 ruby gem for Ruby on Rails (Sprockets) and Compass.

There has not been a release yet, but if you'd like to try out the latest development version, add this to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bootstrap', git: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem'
```
