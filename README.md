# bootstrap-sass 3.0!

Welcome to the 3 branch. This is living on the wild side of life.

3 might be close to release, but stuff will break.

This certainly won't be merged into master (and the commit messages will be horrible) since we will pull from jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap as per usual, but this is an attempt so you can see and try out Bootstrap 3 with you application.
